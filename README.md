Open Source Community: Integration testing is a software testing methodology to test the integration of two or more systems. With Relativity® applications, this typically means the integration between your Relativity application's code and one or more Relativity instances. These components are tested as a single group or organized in an iterative manner. We have created Relativity Integration Test Helpers to assist you with writing high-quality, low-effort integration tests for your Relativity application. You can use this framework to test event handlers, agents, custom pages, or any workflow that combines these Relativity extensibility points.

The _develop_ branch is in active development and is subject to breaking changes.
 
A build of this github project's _master_ branch is available as a [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RelativityDev.RelativityTestHelpers/).
 
This project requires references to the Relativity® SDK. You may obtain the necessary assemblies from NuGet, by contacting Relativity support by email at support@relativity.com, by pulling them from your Relativity instance at C:\Program Files\kCura Corporation, or by installing the SDK from the [Community Portal](https://community.relativity.com/s/files).
